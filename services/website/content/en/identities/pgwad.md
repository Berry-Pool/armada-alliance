description: PGWAD pool is run using Raspi. Will upgrade to M1 mini if needed. I am an engineer with 20+ yrs of experience in Embedded Systems SW and HW. Recently focussing on AI. I started investing time in blockchain after I realized the power of SingularityNet. This brought me to Cardano and pulled me into starting a stakepool. My main goal is to understand AI and Blockchain. Help create knowledge-base towards this with the focus on low power.
